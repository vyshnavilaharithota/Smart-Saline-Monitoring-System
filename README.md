# Smart Saline Monitoring System

The IoT based saline monitoring device acts as an assist to nurses and doctors in efficiently monitoring the patients fed with saline. The doctor or nurse is alerted when the saline level in the bottle is below threshold level or critical, and the flow is automatically stopped when the saline level reaches the minimal level. Infrared sensors are used in the proposed system to determine if liquid level is normal or critical. The nodeMCU, i.e., Wi-Fi module, is interfaced and notification is sent to the mobile application developed.


**Working/Methodology**

The entire functionality of our system is broadly categorized into 3 parts.

1. To fetch the saline level status from the IR sensor.

2. To alert the caretakers through an app.

3. To stop the reverse flow of blood.

**Conclusion**
As the world is growing enormously in terms of technology in all fields especially in medical field, this system is an aid by engineering to medicine. The module developed met the objectives we set. It’s a convenient, reliable and effortless saline monitoring system. It avoids the harmful situations of patient’s health owing to negligence towards saline completion. The system is fully automatic in terms of monitoring the saline status and can handle the hazardous blood reverse flow situation. The implementation of alert system became easy with IoT, which made this system more flexible when compared to existing methods.
